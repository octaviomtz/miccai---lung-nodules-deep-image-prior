\begin{abstract}
The presence of lung nodules is the key feature of lung cancer diagnosis. They are commonly identified  by an experienced radiologist in a computer tomography (CT) scan. In recent years, different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures have been proposed to support this diagnosis. However, both radiologists and CNNs can only identify nodules that are already formed or at least have a recognizable structure. This can leave out early-stage nodules which are fundamental in the detection of early-stage lung cancer. In this study we extended the deep image prior inpainting technique to 3D volumes CT scans. We applied this technique to 800 CT scans from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset. Specifically, we masked out the lung nodules using the union of the segmentations masks provided by a maximum of four annotators. The aim was to produce, for each scan, a corresponding volume that reproduces the original scan but does not contain any annotated nodule from the original image. We expect that the generated dataset contains the anatomical characteristics of the lungs before the nodules appearance. Once the generated dataset was obtained we employed a generative model (cycleGAN) to produce images that represent the nodules' evolution. Both the generated dataset using deep image prior and the images showing nodule progression were qualitatively assessed by experienced radiologists. We expect that this technique and the obtained dataset help to understand lung nodule progression in lung cancer and to improve early-stage detection.

\section{First Section}
\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.
